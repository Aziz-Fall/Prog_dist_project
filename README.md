# Movie app 

the goal of this project is to use `the movieDB` API to recover data
and display them. We use these technologies JavaScript, CSS, HTML, Spring Boot, and Docker. We also use some resources like box icons , owl carousel https://owlcarousel2.github.io/OwlCarousel2/. This app is an responsive application.

## Installation 

The installation is very simple, make sure you have installed Docker and java 17.
Once you build the java project, launch docker and run the script `install.sh`. 
After that the project will build and and exposed on the port `8080`.

### NB
I invite you to edit DockerFile if you have not java 17 and put your java version in Dokerfile and finaly you rebuild java project and run the script `install.sh`.
